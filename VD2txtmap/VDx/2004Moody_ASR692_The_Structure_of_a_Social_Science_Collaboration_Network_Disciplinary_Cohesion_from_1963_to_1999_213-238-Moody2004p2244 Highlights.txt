Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years? Recent work in  
the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction  
patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks  
affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration  
networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since  
the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship network. The results show  
that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty  
and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work.  
However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely  
unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping  
specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical  
development in sociology.
