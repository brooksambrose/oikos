Abstract

Page 1, 0.5%: 
Topic modeling provides a valuable method for identifying the linguistic contexts that surround social  
institutions or policy domains. This article uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze how one such  
policy domain, government assistance to artists and arts organizations, was framed in almost 8000 articles.  
These comprised all articles that referred to government support for the arts in the U.S. published in five U.S.  
newspapers between 1986 and 1997-a period during which such assistance, once noncontroversial,  
became a focus of contention. We illustrate the strengths of topic modeling as a means of analyzing large  
text corpora, discuss the proper choice of models and interpretation of model results, describe means of  
validating topic-model solutions, and demonstrate the use of topic models in combination with other  
statistical tools to estimate differences between newspapers in the prevalence of different frames.  
Throughout, we emphasize affinities between the topic-modeling approach and such central concepts in  
the study of culture as framing, polysemy, heteroglossia, and the relationality of meaning

If this interpretation is correct,  
then the number of words assigned to Topic 8 in any month should be a function of the incidence  
of terms that index broader themes of cultural contention. As indicators, we used "culture war"  
(which appeared in fifty-six articles), and "moral decline" and "moral decay" (each of which  
appeared in two). These compound terms were not identified as entities in the modeling stage and  
therefore did not influence the topic model results. The hypothesis receives strong support: for  
every text per month in which one of these phrases appears, the number of words assigned to  
Topic 8 increases by 578 (p < .001). 
Note: !! This can not be sound statistically. If the topic captures the co-occurrence of "culture" and "war" then it will certainly be correlated with the phrase "culture war".
