Abstract 
Scholars have long been interested in the relationship between the amount of consensus in an academic 
field and the amount of scholarly production. In this paper, I describe previous theory and research that suggest 
four possible relationships between the amount of scholarly production and the degree of consensus. These 
relationships are tested with data on the content of 50 sub-debates in the field of bioethics from 1973 to 1995. I 
find support for the conclusion that increased consensus leads to increased scholarly production. I conclude by 
discussing the implications of these findings for the humanities in general and bioethics in particular

In a theoretical field, the consensus that is most important is what I will call 
discursive consensus – an agreed upon language to describe the phenomena. If it were an 
empirical field, discursive consensus would be followed by a second stage: having achieved 
discursive consensus about the problem, an empirical agenda could get under way to determine 
what could be called a substantive consensus
Note: !! An exchange theory, where conformity is exchanged for the right to idiosyncrasy, is an alternative to a consensus theory. This matches the distinction between orthodoxy and orthopraxy.

Discursive 
consensus in this case entails agreeing to use the same language to describe abortion. Having 
achieved a consensus about what abortion is really about, then, in the Kuhnian version, the debate 
would then move on to the much larger set of detailed questions and debates

Of course, this Kuhnian mechanism must, on a micro level, work through either the 
gatekeepers of publishing (editors, reviewers), or the behavior of individual writers themselves. 
Studies of peer review in publishing also suggest that this mechanism may indeed be operating 
(Campanario, 1998). One prominent finding is that ‘‘when scholars do not share conceptions of 
appropriate research problems, theoretical approaches, or research techniques, they tend to view 
each other’s work as deficient and unworthy of publication’’ (Hargens, 1988:147)
Note: !! So why insist on calling a paradigm consensus when there is a power structure behind it?

(1) If the lagged values of the change in consensus significantly predict the change in the amount 
of production, but the lagged values of change in the amount of production do not predict the 
change in the amount of consensus, then the change in the amount of consensus ‘‘Granger 
causes’’ the change in the amount of production. (This would support either hypothesis 1 or 2, 
depending on the sign of the coefficients.)

(2) Inversely, if the lagged values of changes in the amount of production significantly predict the 
change in the amount of consensus, but the lagged values of changes in consensus do not 
predict the change in the amount of production, then the change in the amount of production 
‘‘Granger causes’’ consensus. (Depending on the sign of the coefficients, this would support 
either hypothesis 3 or 4.)

(3) If both directional tests have significant results, then a feedback mechanism or what economists 
call a ‘‘bilateral causality’’ system is suggested. (I will not discuss this more complicated 
phenomena further because it does not emerge as a major component of the findings.)

(4) If neither 1, 2, or 3 holds true, then the two variables are independent.

Given that the underlying mechanism is academic publishing processes, a very long lag 
structure is called for. The mechanism is this: gatekeepers note that a debate has changed in some 
way and begin to make selections differently; followed by the perception of these changes by the 
authors; followed by a change in their writing style; followed by a change in what is submitted to 
the gatekeepers
