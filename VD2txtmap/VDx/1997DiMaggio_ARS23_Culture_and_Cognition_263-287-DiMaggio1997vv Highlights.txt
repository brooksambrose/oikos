ABSTRACT  
Recent work in cognitive psychology and social cognition bears heavily on con- 
cerns of sociologists of culture. Cognitive research confirms views of culture as  
fragmented; clarifies the roles of institutions and agency; and illuminates supra- 
individual aspects of culture. Individuals experience culture as disparate bits of  
information and as schematic structures that organize that information. Culture  
carried by institutions, networks, and social movements diffuses, activates, and  
selects among available schemata. Implications for the study of identity, collective  
memory, social classification, and logics of action are developed
