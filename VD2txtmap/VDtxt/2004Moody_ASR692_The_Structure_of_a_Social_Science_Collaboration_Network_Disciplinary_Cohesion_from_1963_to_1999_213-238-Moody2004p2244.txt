The Structure of a Social Science  
Collaboration Network:  
Disciplinary Cohesion from 1963 to 1999  
James Moody  
The Ohio State University  
Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years? Recent work in  
the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction  
patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks  
affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration  
networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since  
the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship network. The results show  
that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty  
and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work.  
However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely  
unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping  
specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical  
development in sociology.  
Science, carved up into a host of detailed stud-  
ies that have no link with one another, no longer  
forms a solid whole.  
Durkheim, 1933 [1984] p. 294  
R ecent work in the sociology of knowledge  
suggests that the set of ideas one holds to  
be true is largely a function of the group of  
people one interacts with and references to  
authorities recognized by the group. This claim  
has been demonstrated in small groups (Martin  
2002) and is consistent with literature on the  
social production of scientific knowledge  
(Babchuk et al. 1999; Crane 1972; Friedkin  
1998; Kuhn 1970). Scientists embedded in col-  
laboration networks share ideas, use similar  
techniques, and otherwise influence each other's  
work. Such effects have been studied in specif-  
ic settings (Friedkin 1998) and implicated in lab  
ethnographies (Collins 1998; Owen-Smith  
2001), but this social interaction structure has  
not been explored for entire disciplines.  
Although we might expect the link between  
networks and ideas to be strongest in small  
groups, a logical extension suggests that long-  
term trends in scientific work might depend on  
the broader pattern of disciplinary social net-  
works.1

similar subgroup effects and captures one facet of the  
AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW, 2004, VOL. 69 (April:213-238) 214 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW  
Commentaries on sociology often describe a  
lack of theoretical consensus without reference  
to social cohesion, though the two should be  
linked because structural cohesion is thought to  
generate coherent idea systems (Durkheim  
[1933] 1984; Hagstrom 1965; Hargens 1975;  
Martin 2002; Moody and White 2003; Whitley  
2000). A network influence model suggests that  
if scientists exchange ideas, research questions,  
methods, and implicit rules for evaluating evi-  
dence with their collaborators, then structural-  
ly cohesive social networks should generate  
consensus, at least with respect to problems  
and methods if not on particular claims about  
the empirical world (Friedkin 1998).2 This work  
suggests that understanding theoretical diversity  
within a discipline requires understanding its  
collaboration structure.  
While a direct mapping from the idea space  
to network structure is often not transparent,  
claims about theoretical consensus in sociology  
suggest three distinct collaboration structures.  
First, many have noted that the discipline has no  
overarching theory but, instead, is theoretically  
fractured and composed of multiple discon-  
nected research specialties. Authors argue that  
reactions against functionalism, rapid growth,  
institutional pressures for productivity, changing  
research techniques, and/or changes in the fund-  
ing environment for social sciences have inter-  
acted to generate self-contained research  
specialties, with unique research techniques and  
standards for the evaluation of evidence (Collins  
2001; Davis 2001; Lieberson and Lynn 2002;  
Stinchcombe 2001). This description suggests a  
highly clustered social network. Second, others  
have argued that scientific production depends  
crucially on a few scientific stars, whose work  
shapes the short-run course of a discipline  
(Allison et al. 1982; Cole and Cole 1973; Merton  
1968; Zuckerman 1977; see also Crane 1972).  
Scientific stars attract a disproportionate level of  
research funding, high-profile appointments,  
and many students and collaborators. Star sys-  
tems suggest an unequal distribution of involve-  
ment in collaboration networks. Finally, changes  
in research practice might interact with perme-  
able theoretical boundaries to allow wide-rang-  
ing collaborations that are not constrained by  
research specialty (Abbott 2001; Hudson 1996).  
For example, an increase in sophisticated quan-  
titative methods, which are (at least on the sur-  
face) substantively neutral, would allow  
collaboration between people with general tech-  
nical skills and those working on particular  
empirical questions. This process suggests a  
wide-reaching structurally cohesive collabora-  
tion network.  
In this paper, I describe the structure of a  
social science collaboration network over time,  
and I link this structure to claims about social sci-  
entific practice.3 I first review literature on net-  
work structure and idea spaces, and link three  
descriptions of the current state of sociological  
practice to hypotheses about the structure of the  
network. I then describe collaboration trends  
and examine explanations for increasing col-  
laboration over time. After describing the data  
source and measures, I first model participation  
in the collaboration network and then model  
position within the network given participation.  
I note two key findings. First, specialty areas dif-  
fer in the likelihood of collaboration, and much  
(but not all) of this difference is due to use of  
quantitative methods. Second, the resulting col-  
laboration network has a large structurally cohe-  
sive core that has been growing steadily since the  
late 1960s (both absolutely and relative to ran-  
dom expectation given growth in the discipline).  
While research specialty predicts having col-  
laborated, specialty is only weakly related to  
position within the collaboration network, sug-  
gesting a relatively equal representation of spe-  
cialties across the disciplinary network.  
intellectual integration of scientific disciplines (Crane  
and Small 1992; Hargens 2000). Citation networks  
are not social networks, however, and thus do not cap-  
ture the informal interaction structure described in  
work on social integration. Recent work has looked  
at the global structure of large-scale collaboration net-  
works in the natural sciences (Newman 2001), but has  
not attempted to explain the features of such networks  
with respect to scientific practice.  
2 That is, scientific competition for distinction  
should produce a race toward new empirical expla-  
nations, but to gain status within a field those claims  
must conform to the general rules of evidence cur-  
rent within the scientific network.  
3 While the majority of all authors in the data I use  
are sociologists, the database does cover sociologi-  
cally relevant work produced by other disciplines. As  
such, while it is technically more accurate to speak of "a social science" collaboration network, I will  
often use "sociology" for simplicity. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 215  
SOCIAL AND THEORETICAL  
INTEGRATION  
NETWORK STRUCTURES AND IDEA SPACES  
There is increasing interest in linking the dis-  
tribution of cultural ideas and practices to the  
interaction structure of social communities  
(Bearman 1993; Burt 1987; Crane 1972; Martin  
2002; Swidler and Arditi 1994). Theorists have  
long argued that one's ideas are a function of  
position in a social setting, which is deeply  
structured by interaction patterns (Durkheim  
[1933] 1984; Mannheim 1936; Simmel 1950).  
Kuhn (1970), for example, argued that belief in  
the empirical validity of theory could be sus-  
tained long past the available empirical evi-  
dence if scientists were embedded in research  
communities who systematically interpreted  
data in similar ways. This implicit perspective  
was made clear in Crane's (1972) work linking  
the rapid development of new ideas to the social  
structure of small "invisible colleges." Crane  
found that research specialties were character-  
ized by a core group of scientists who collabo-  
rated with each other and generated a  
disproportionate volume of new ideas.  
Recent work has built on these ideas to direct-  
ly link network structure to the distribution of  
ideas. Martin (2002) argues that while predict-  
ing the specific content of ideas is often not pos-  
sible, we can link the shape of an idea space to  
the structure of a network. In the small groups  
that Martin studied, belief consensus depended  
on the authority structure within the group's  
social network. Similar work on ideational dif-  
fusion suggests that people influence the beliefs  
of their social contacts. As part of a broader proj-  
ect devoted to understanding the distribution  
of ideas, Friedkin (1998) shows that agreement  
across different groups of scientists depends  
on loosely overlapping cohesive groups in the  
underlying social network. Thus, while  
Friedkin's mechanism differs from Martin's  
(interpersonal influence as opposed to hierar-  
chical authority), the general point is quite clear:  
Belief consensus depends critically on the shape  
of the underlying social network.4 If this work  
is correct, then we can draw hypotheses about  
the structure of interaction networks in the social  
sciences from descriptions of scientific practice  
and speculate about the potential for scientific  
consensus in a field based on the observed col-  
laboration pattern.  
THEORY AND PRACTICE IN SOCIAL SCIENCE  
THEORETICAL FRAGMENTATION. There is much lit-  
erature on the lack of theoretical consensus in  
sociology (Abbott 2000; Collins 1986; Connell  
2000; Davis 2001).5 For example, Stinchcombe  
(2001) argues that sociology likely has a dim  
future, because "[first] it is unlikely to develop  
much consensus on who best represents the  
sociologists' sociologist to be hired in elite  
departments. Second, ..., it is unlikely to be  
able to argue with one voice about what is 'ele-  
mentary"' (p. 86). This problem is compound-  
ed by multiple empirical specialties in the  
discipline. "The wide variety of substantive  
subject matter in disintegrated disciplines, and  
the strong boundaries around substantive spe-  
cialties, means that people cannot get interest-  
ed in each other's work." (p.89), and many  
authors comment on this basic state of intel-  
lectual anomie.  
Sociology's rapid growth also contributes to  
perceptions of fractionalization. Simspon and  
Simpson (2001) report a nearly 5-fold increase  
in ASA membership since the 1950s, and a rise  
in the number of ASA sections (5 in 1961, 25  
in 1987, 44 in 2003). However, fears about dis-  
ciplinary fractionalization based on number of  
sections and multitudes of topics risk mistaking  
growth on the margins for separation. When  
viewed as a potential mixing space defined by  
the intersection of research areas (Crane and  
Small 1992; Daipha 2001; Ennis 1992), simple  
increases in the number of sections tell us little  
about how people mix across these areas.  
Visions of a theoretically fractured social sci-  
ence suggest a highly clustered social network.  
If substantive boundaries mean that people are  
not interested in each other's work, then people  
should turn to fellow specialists as potential  
4 There is much literature within social networks  
on the various mechanisms that generate consensus  
from networks (see Burt 1987 for a review).  
5 Not all of this literature is negative, and several  
people comment on what is good about the discipline,  
including the diversity of ideas and interest of top-  
ics, and many attempts are made at theoretical inte-  
gration or reformulations (cf Lieberson and Lynn  
2002; Skvoretz 1998). 216 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW  
collaborators. Graduate students will be trained  
within particular specialties and a shop-pro-  
duction model should build distinct communi-  
ties surrounding particular topics. The resulting  
network will admit to clear clusters with little  
collaboration crossing specialty boundaries.  
The social network model that best fits this  
description is the small-world model (Milgram  
1969; Watts 1999; Watts and Strogatz 1998).  
Intuitively, a small-world network is any network  
where the level of local clustering (one's col-  
laborators are also collaborators with each other)  
is high, but the average number of steps between  
actors is small. An archetypical small-world  
network will have many distinct clusters, con-  
nected to each other by a small number of links.  
Distinct research clusters will likely inhibit  
broad theoretical integration, since theory will  
progress largely within distinct research groups.  
STAR PRODUCTION. Past research on stratifi-  
cation in the sciences has identified large  
inequality in the returns to scientific labor  
(Allison, Long and Krauze 1982; Cole and Cole  
1973; Merton 1968). Although most scientists  
labor in obscurity, a small number of scientists  
receive disproportionate recognition. This has  
been clearly demonstrated for indicators such as  
citations, number of publications, or grants.  
However, research suggests that collaboration  
is also unequally divided. Crane (1972) found  
that a small number of very prominent scientists  
form the core of each specialty's collaboration  
network and that most others were connected to  
the rest of the community through these high-  
ly active individuals. This central position helps  
explain why core scientists were able to so rap-  
idly diffuse their ideas through the community,  
and we would expect that those with many col-  
laborators are likely to be influential (at least  
locally). Newman (2001) turns collaboration  
itself into a status marker and asks, "Who is the  
Best Connected Scientist?"6  
The large inequality in numbers of collabo-  
rators can be explained through a process of  
preferential attachment. High-status scientists  
make attractive collaborators since one's own  
status is a function of the status of those to  
whom one is connected (Bonacich 1987; Gould  
2002; Leifer 1988). This implies that people  
will seek to work with high-status scientists, and  
this process will be self-reinforcing. The typi-  
cal preferential attachment process suggests  
that as new people enter the network, they col-  
laborate with those already in the network with  
probability proportional to their current number  
of partners. The critical structural feature for the  
preferential attachment model is that star actors  
are responsible for connecting the network.  
The network model that best fits a star pro-  
duction process is a scale-free model (Barabasi  
and Albert 1999; Newman 2000). Barabasi  
(1999) proved that when networks are con-  
structed through a preferential attachment  
process, the resulting distribution of the num-  
ber of unique collaborators (called the degree  
distribution) will have a scale-free power-law  
distribution, such that the probability of having  
k partners is distributed as k-v, and we can thus  
use the degree distribution to test for a prefer-  
ential attachment process.7 Theoretical inte-  
gration in such networks will likely depend  
crucially on ideas generated by star producers,  
as collaborators follow the lead of those respon-  
sible for connecting the entire network.  
PERMEABLE THEORETICAL BOUNDARIES AND  
GENERIC METHODS. Abbott (2001) also argues  
that the social sciences have little theoretical  
consensus, but he does not suggest that this  
generates a clustered discipline. Instead, he sug-  
gests that the nature of sociology creates per-  
meable theoretical boundaries that make it  
impossible for sociology to exclude ideas from  
the discipline once they are introduced (p. 6; see  
also Daipha 2001). Moreover, the process of the-  
oretical development is not linear, but instead  
follows a "fractal walk" through the available  
idea space. Pushed by competition for status,  
proponents of one set of ideas attempt to van-  
6 Competition among mathematicians over having  
the smallest Erdds number speaks similarly to the sta-  
tus attached to one's position in a collaboration net-  
work.  
7 Not finding a power-law distribution will falsi-  
fy a preferential attachment model, but the opposite  
direction does not hold: finding a power-law distri-  
bution is consistent with preferential attachment, but  
other processes can also generate power-law distri-  
butions. This asymmetry has lead to some misun-  
derstandings in the current literature over large-scale  
networks. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 217  
quish another, only to find that they need to  
reinvent those same ideas later. This results in  
a constant revisiting of ideas and interests in the  
discipline (though usually from a different direc-  
tion) as actors continuously loop through wide  
sections of the available idea space.  
Permeability allows for cross-topic collabo-  
ration, since the same theoretical frame (eco-  
logical, competition, diffusion through  
networks, etc.) can be applied to multiple empir-  
ical questions. This implies that while people  
might specialize in techniques or approaches,  
these techniques and approaches are transferable  
across research questions. If this is the case,  
then the boundless character of sociology would  
promote wide-ranging collaboration. Authors  
with particular technical, empirical or theoret-  
ical skills will mix freely with those who have  
worked in different research areas, in an attempt  
to establish a new position by combining pre-  
vious work. If many engage in this kind of  
cross-fertilization, mixing across multiple areas,  
the result will be a social structure with few clear  
divisions.  
The social network model that best fits this  
description is structural cohesion (White and  
Harary 2001; Moody and White 2003; White et  
al. 2002). A network is structurally cohesive  
when ties are distributed evenly across the net-  
work, implying no clear fissures in the under-  
lying structure (Markovsky 1998). Moody and  
White (2003) show that this network feature  
can be exactly characterized as the extent to  
which a network will remain connected when  
nodes are removed from the network. Such net-  
works are, topologically, the structural opposite  
of those implied by a preferential attachment  
process. In preferential attachment networks,  
most relational paths pass through highly active  
nodes, which if removed would disconnect the  
network. This key structural location gives star  
actors unique control over the spread of ideas  
in a network. In structurally cohesive networks,  
in contrast, ties are distributed such that stars in  
the network are not crucial for connecting the  
network, and ideas are more likely to spread over  
the entire network. A structurally cohesive net-  
work suggests increasing theoretical integra-  
tion, at least within the multiply-connected core  
collaboration network.  
The three models for large-scale networks  
correspond theoretically to expectations about  
social scientific production. If authors in well-  
defined research specialties collaborate with  
each other, then we would expect to find distinct  
clusters in the knowledge production network,  
which corresponds to a small-world network  
structure. If the network was generated by pref-  
erential attachment, where young authors write  
with well-established stars, then we would  
expect to find a scale-free network structure. If  
the multiple theoretical perspectives found in the  
social sciences admit to permeable boundaries  
allowing specialists to mix freely, then we would  
expect no strong fissures in the network, but  
instead find a structurally cohesive network.  
Before looking at the structure of the coau-  
thorship network, we need to first examine the  
trends and determinants of coauthorship.  
SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION TRENDS  
The probability of coauthoring differs across  
disciplines and over time. Coauthorship is more  
common in the natural sciences than in the  
social sciences, but has been increasing steadi-  
ly across all fields (Endersby 1996; Fisher et al.  
1998; Hargens 1975; Laband and Tollison  
2000). The changing likelihood of coauthor-  
ship is evident in Figure 1, which shows the pro-  
portion of all articles coauthored in ASR from  
inception and in Sociological Abstracts from  
1963 to 1999.  
Several explanations have been given for the  
increase in coauthorship over time (Laband and  
Tollison 2000; McDowell and Michael 1983).  
Funding requirements, particularly in large lab  
settings, might induce collaboration (Laband  
and Tollison 2000; Zuckerman and Merton  
1973). While social scientists are rarely as  
dependent on labs, the rise of large-scale data  
collection efforts suggests a similar team-pro-  
duction model. Training differences between  
disciplines might also account for coauthorship  
differences. Advanced work by PhD students in  
the natural sciences is usually closely related to  
an advisor's work, and commonly results in col-  
laboration. Social science students, in contrast,  
tend to work on projects that are more inde-  
pendent.  
Other explanations focus on the division of  
labor among scientists. In high-growth, fast-  
changing specialties, we would expect to see  
more coauthorship because it is easier to bring  
in a new author than it is to learn new material  
oneself. Hudson (1996) argues that the increase 218 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW

Figure 1. Coauthorship Trends in Sociology  
in coauthorship in economics is due to the rise  
in quantitative methods. As quantitative tech-  
niques become more complicated, specialists are  
often added to research teams to do the analy-  
ses. These points are well supported by the  
lower rates of coauthorship among theoretical  
or historical specialties compared to coauthor-  
ship in quantitative work (Endersby 1996; Fisher  
et al. 1998). For social scientists, this suggests  
that work that is difficult to divide, such as  
ethnography, will be coauthored less often  
(Babchuk et al. 1999).  
DATA AND METHODS  
My primary interest is to identify the observed  
structure of the social science collaboration net-  
work to distinguish between the three models  
suggested by commentaries on sociological  
practice. Because participation is a necessary  
minimum requirement for influence in the net-  
work, I first model participation in the network,  
and then examine the structure of the network  
among those who have coauthored.  
SAMPLE AND SOURCE  
To examine network participation and embed-  
dedness, I use all English journal articles list-  
ed in SociologicalAbstracts that were published  
between 1963 and 1999. Nineteen sixty three is  
the earliest date listed in the database, and 1999  
was chosen to ensure complete coverage with-  
in years. The Sociological Abstracts database  
covers all journals in sociology proper (all ASA  
journals, for example), and many journals pub-  
lishing sociologically relevant work in other  
fields (such as anthropology, political science  
and economics), and coverage has followed the  
growth in social science over the last 36 years.8  
Sociological Abstracts limits coverage to jour-  
nal articles, neglecting conference presenta-  
tions, book reviews, essays, or books. While  
these types of collaboration represent social  
contact, each has only spotty coverage in the  
database. The exclusion of books is perhaps  
most troubling, to the degree that books are  
more common in particular specialties such as  
social movements or theory. While unfortunate,  
the generally lower rate of coauthorship in books  
8 There is no published universe of journals to  
compare with, so it is impossible to know definitively  
if change in the number of journals reflects growth in the discipline or changes in database inclusion. SA  
provides a coverage indicator, however, that tells  
how often articles from a particular journal are  
indexed. I use this indicator in the models below to  
help account for possible inclusion differences. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 219  
may offset some of the error introduced by their  
exclusion.  
Authors are identified by name, which can  
lead to problems when names are inconsistent  
over time. Errors usually occur due to incon-  
sistent use of middle initials or when two peo-  
ple have the same name. Based on the observed  
distribution of names, first and last names were  
coded as either common or uncommon.9 If two  
records differed only in their middle initials  
and had either the same uncommon last name  
or the same uncommon first name (Howard (a  
common name) Aldrich (an uncommon name)  
and Howard E. Aldrich, for example), they were  
coded as being the same person. Second, the  
coauthorship pattern was used to identify papers  
where the same author might use slightly dif-  
ferent names. For example, I assumed that two  
papers written by "David Jacobs" and "David  
R. Jacobs", with identical sets of coauthors,  
were written by the same person and, for that  
paper, "David Jacobs" is recoded to "David R.  
Jacobs."'10  
MEASURES  
Actor information available from Sociological  
Abstracts is somewhat limited, but we can get  
the total number of unique publications, the  
number of unique coauthors, cohort, and time  
in the discipline (date of last publication minus  
date of first publication). Publication volume  
accounts for productivity and increased oppor-  
tunities to coauthor. If the network structure  
were random, embeddedness within the core  
of the network would be determined entirely by  
number of collaborators. Due to changing trends  
over time, those who enter the network later  
should be more likely to coauthor than those  
entering earlier. Star production models suggest  
that those who have been in the discipline longer  
should be more deeply embedded than those  
who just entered. Finally, by linking first names  
to the Census' gender distribution of first names,  
we can estimate the effects of gender on col-  
laboration and position in the network.11  
Every article in Sociological Abstracts is  
assigned to one of 149 detailed subject codes,  
which are nested within 36 broad specialty  
areas. These 36 areas are used to capture  
research specialties.12 Sociological Abstracts  
also lists the number of tables in every article,  
which provides a simple proxy for whether the  
paper uses quantitative methods.13 To control for  
changes in journals covered by Sociological  
Abstracts, I include an indicator for how com-  
pletely SociologicalAbstracts indexes the jour-  
nals where people publish. Coverage is indicated  
at three levels: complete (100% of the articles  
in that journal are indexed), priority (more than  
50% of the articles are indexed), and selective  
(less than 50% are indexed).  
I construct the collaboration network by  
assigning an edge between any two people who  
wrote a paper together, regardless of the how  
often they have coauthored. Figure 2 demon-  
9 A cutoff of 15 appearances of a name was used  
to distinguish common from uncommon.  
10 Prior work on large collaboration networks has  
not attempted to identify these types of errors. An  
alternative source for name cleaning would be to use  
author affiliation. Unfortunately, Sociological  
Abstracts, only lists affiliation for the first author, and  
authors may have multiple affiliations (such as a  
research center and an academic department). While  
such corrections are important to help ensure accu-  
rate measures, the general graph features examined  
here do not differ significantly if I use the corrected  
versus the non-corrected data.  
1 This results in a probability score based on the  
proportion of people with a given first name who are  
male. Since not all first names can be matched, using this measure results in missing data for 32% of cases,  
likely predominantly among rare and foreign names.  
The substantive model results for the other variables  
do not differ with the inclusion of the gender meas-  
ure. Tables not using gender are available from the  
author upon request.  
12 The sociological abstract area categories are  
likely not substantively ideal, being subject to both  
errors of misclassification and internal heterogene-  
ity. However, they remain the only tractable infor-  
mation on substantive area. While each record  
contains keywords describing content, the sheer num-  
ber of such words (over 8000 unique keywords) would require some sort of categorization routine, the  
development of which is not transparent.  
13 This is also an imperfect measure, since while  
all quantitative papers include tables some non-quan- titative papers also include textual tables, so this  
measure over-estimates the number of quantitative  
papers. At the aggregate level used here, the small  
number of nonquantitative papers with tables wash-  
es out relative to differences across specialties. 220 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW

Figure 2. Constructing Collaboration Networks  
strates how the networks are constructed from  
the authorship data.14  
The top panel of figure 2 is a schematic rep-  
resentation of data as given in Sociological  
Abstracts, with authors (squares) connected to  
the papers (circles) they write. The data include  
single authored papers (persons A,B,C and D)  
as well as those with more authors. The struc-  
ture on the top right of figure 2 represents a large  
connected set of authors, each of whom has  
coauthored with someone who has coauthored  
with someone else. The bottom panel of figure  
2 provides the resulting collaboration network.  
Those who have written only single authored  
papers do not participate in the collaboration  
network, but can be represented as structural iso-  
lates. Pairs of people who have only coauthored  
with each other are represented as isolated dyads  
{EF, GH}.  
The largest connected component is the max-  
imal set of people who are connected by a chain  
of any length to each other. The large structure  
at the bottom right of figure 2 is the largest  
connected component. Nested within this com-  
ponent is a bicomponent (circled). While a com-  
ponent requires only a single traceable path  
between each actor, a bicomponent requires  
that there be at least two node-independent  
paths connecting every pair of actors in the net-  
work. Simmel (1950) argued that the necessary  
condition for a group is that a supra-individual  
body remains even if a person leaves.  
Bicomponents meet this criterion, since the  
group remains connected even if a single per-  
son is deleted (Moody and White 2003). This  
conception scales, as tricomponents (3-node  
independent paths), 4-components, and higher  
order k-components identify increasingly cohe-  
sive subgroups in a network.

An actor's degree is the number of unique peo-  
ple they are directly connected to, in this con-  
text the number of unique collaborators. The  
degree distribution for the example network is  
given in the lower right of figure 2. Geodesic  
paths define network distance, as the number of  
intermediaries on the shortest path connected  
two nodes in a network. So, for example, nodes  
L and S are 3 steps apart.  
PUBLICATION TRENDS  
The primary constraints on the shape of a col-  
laboration network are the distributions of the  
number of papers people publish and the num-  
ber of authors on a paper. Table 1 below gives  
these distributions for all papers in the dataset  
(including those with only a single author).  
Of all authors that appear in Sociological  
Abstracts, 66% appear only once, and an addi-  
tional 15% appear only twice, with the number  
of publications dropping quickly after that.  
Publication volume has increased slightly over  
time. The percent of authors with only one pub-  
lication has dropped, from 71% in the 75-85  
period to 67% in the 89-99 period and the tail  
of the distribution is a little fatter.'5 About 67%  
of papers have 1 author, and 22% (66% of all  
coauthored papers) have only 2 authors.  
Coauthorship increases over time, both in  
instance (31% in the early period compared to  
38% in the later period) and extent (the average  
number of authors per coauthored paper was  
2.40 in the early period, compared to 2.70 in the  
late period). Even with the increase over time,  
these levels are low compared to the physical  
sciences, which range from an average of 2.2  
authors per paper in computer science to 8.9  
authors per paper in high-energy physics  
(Newman 2001). A low number of authors per  
paper decreases the size of complete clusters  
formed through common authorship on a sin-  
gle paper.  
SPECIALTY AREA AND NETWORK  
PARTICIPATION  
Having ever coauthored a paper is a necessary  
condition for being embedded in the larger col-  
laboration network. If the collaboration net-  
work shapes commitment to particular ways of  
doing science, then identifying systematic dif-  
ferences in who collaborates will identify key  
differences in those exposed to the information  
15 Note that the period-specific distributions only  
count publications within that period. Because the  
periods do not cover all dates and individuals can pub-  
lish in both periods, the three columns do not nec-  
essarily sum.

Welfare.16 The number of articles in the data-  
base has increased by about 350 papers per year  
over the past 30 years (column 4, row 1), and  
overall growth by specialty can be seen in the  
rest of the table (the sum of the specialty cells  
equals the total). Culture and theory papers are  
among the least likely to be coauthored, as are  
papers in the sociology of knowledge, sociolo-  
gy of science, language and arts, radical soci-  
ology, Marxist sociology, political sociology,  
and visual sociology. Papers on social welfare  
are the most likely to be coauthored, followed  
closely by those in social psychology, the fam-  
ily, sociology of health and medicine, and social  
problems and welfare. Work in these areas often  
involves large datasets and cumbersome analy-  
ses that lend themselves to a substantive divi-  
sion of labor. There is a moderate correlation  
between growth in a specialty and the propor-  
tion of papers that are coauthored, though fields  
such as social psychology and social theory /  
historical sociology clearly buck the trend. The  
proportion of papers that are coauthored has  
increased by about 1% per year over the time  
span covered in the database, and this trend has  
been largely linear. Growth in coauthorship has  
been relatively steady within specialties as well,  
with most having growth levels close to the  
average.  
While the SociologicalAbstracts data are too  
limited to test many of the proposed explana-  
tions for increases in coauthorship, we can iden-  
tify the contribution of research method and  
specialty area.17 Figure 3 plots the proportion  
of papers within a specialty area that are coau-  
thored against the proportion that have tables,  
for two time periods.  
The figure shows a strong correlation  
between the proportion of papers with tables in  
16 Social Welfare is a large category including  
topics such as AIDS, health care, addiction, adoles-  
cence, illness and health care, marital and family  
problems, crime & public safety, etc. This category has the highest coauthorship rate and is among the  
fastest growing areas in the dataset. To ensure that the  
observed results were not simply an artifact of this  
category, I have replicated the main findings for the  
paper on a dataset that excludes these papers from the  
set. There are no substantively meaningful differ-  
ences when these papers are excluded.  
17 Previous versions of this paper included data on  
a limited set ofjournals and examined funding, men-  
torship and location explanations for coauthorship. These tables are available on request.

each specialty and the proportion of papers that  
are coauthored.18 The returns to quantitative  
work increased between the two periods, sug-  
gesting a stronger effect of quantitative work on  
coauthorship in the most recent decade. A sim-  
ple explanation for the change over time is that  
as quantitative work becomes more sophisti-  
cated, methodological specialists are brought  
into more projects. The increase in specialized  
knowledge needed for advanced techniques  
increases the value to dividing labor in papers  
(Hudson 1996).  
Table 3 provides an individual level model of  
having ever coauthored. Substantive area is  
coded from the SociologicalAbstracts as a count  
of the number of publications for each author  
in each specialty area. Within each of the three  
time windows, Model 1 presents a baseline  
model containing only the actor history, demo-  
graphic, publication and journal coverage vari-  
ables (the first 6 rows of the table) and a single  
specialty area. The specialty area coefficients in  
model 1 are thus the coefficients for separate  
models with the single specialty area and the  
first 6 variables listed in the table. We can thus  
interpret the odds ratio as the change in the  
odds of coauthorship for each publication in  
that specialty, relative to all other specialty  
areas. Since people can write in multiple areas,  
and we would expect some areas to be much  
more closely related than others (Crane and  
Small 1992; Daipha 2001), model 2 presents a  
multivariate version of model 1, entering all of  
the specialty areas simultaneously.19 Model 3  
adds an indicator of quantitative work, the pro-  
portion of an author's papers that have tables, to  
model 2, allowing us to identify specialty dif-  
ference net of research method.  
The models show that those with greater time  
in the discipline (exposure) are slightly more  
likely to coauthor, though the magnitude of this  
effect is small.20 The cohort effects are consis-  
tent, with those publishing later having a high-  
er likelihood of having coauthored, though again  
the effect is relatively small. The strongest pub-  
lication effect is the simple number of publica-  
tions. Each additional publication increases the  
odds of coauthoring by 1.28. Consistent with  
prior research in economics, the odds of men  
coauthoring are about .64 times the odds of  
women coauthoring, though this effect decreas-  
es (to .73) once you control for specialty area.21  
The actor-attribute effects remain largely  
constant when controlling for specialty or exam-  
ined over time. The clearest exception is that the  
effect of the number of publications increases  
when controlling for specialty area, and is  
stronger in the latter period than in the early peri-  
od. Similarly, cohort effects are less pronounced  
in the later period than in the early period, like-  
ly reflecting the greater ubiquity of coauthorship  
over time.  
There is a clear effect of specialty on the  
likelihood of having coauthored. Authors who  
write in historical, qualitative, radical and inter-  
pretive specialties are less likely to coauthor  
than those writing in more positivist and quan-  
titative specialties. For example, the odds of  
coauthorship controlling for specialty overlap in  
Marxist sociology are about half (.57) those in  
sociology of education, and those writing in  
social history and theory are about .58 times as  
likely. In contrast, those writing on the 18 The correlation in the family early period is .82, in the  
late period it is .89. The change in slope between the  
two periods is statistically significant atp = .017. To  
avoid clutter in the figure, each specialty is only  
labeled for one time period. An alternative to using  
the specialty areas would be to aggregate within  
journals, because with the exception of a few gener-  
al journals, journals specialize in particular topics.  
This figure is available on request, and substantive  
results are the same.  
19 Since the categories are exhaustive, at least one  
must be omitted. There is no substantive reason to  
pick one area over another as the reference catego-  
ry, but a consistent reference category aids in evalu-  
ating change over time. In all models I used the  
sociology of education as the reference category,  
because the odds of coauthorship were very close to  
average in both time periods, the rate of change in  
coauthorship mirrors the rate of change overall, and  
the area is large enough to provide a stable reference  
category.  
20 To avoid redundancy in the text, I will focus  
comments mainly on the pooled 1963-1999 models,  
and mention the other models only to the extent that  
the patterns differ from this model.  
21 In addition, the control variables for Sociological Abstracts coverage are also significant, showing that  
journals included only incidentally (the omitted cat-  
egory) are slightly more likely to be coauthored,  
though this effect either becomes insignificant or  
changes direction when substantive area is included. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 225

are 1.61 times more likely to coauthor, those in  
social psychology are 1.91 times more likely to  
coauthor and social welfare writers are 2.19  
times as likely to coauthor, net of individual  
attributes, index coverage, publication levels  
and overlaps among area specialties. The impor-  
tance of specialty area for collaboration is clear-  
ly indicated in the increase in model fit. The  
pseudo-R2 increases significantly with the addi-  
tion of specialty area.  
The likelihood of coauthorship by specialty  
area does evidence some interesting changes  
over time. Many of the fields that are unlikely  
to coauthor are comparatively more unlikely to  
coauthor in the later period than in the early peri-  
od, suggesting that the importance of specialty  
for coauthorship has increased over time. For  
example, while those writing in feminist gen-  
der studies had about average coauthorship lev-  
els in the early period, the odds of coauthorship  
in this specialty are about half the average in the  
later period. Similarly, those writing in histor-  
ical sociology and theory had an odds ratio of  
.68 in the early period, compared to .42 in the  
later period. The trend is replicated in reverse  
for fields where coauthorship is more common,  
though perhaps not as uniformly. For example,  
while methodologists had average levels of  
coauthorship in the early period (not statistically  
different from feminist gender studies), odds in  
the later period are about 1.25 times that of  
average groups. Similar patterns are evident for  
work on the family. Social Psychology, on the  
other hand, is relatively more likely to coauthor  
in the early period than the later period, likely  
reflecting its 'first-mover' status in coauthorship.  
Model 3 adds the indicator of quantitative  
work, and shows that quantitative work has a  
strong association with coauthorship. Overall,  
those writing quantitative papers are over 5  
times more likely to have coauthored than some-  
one who has not written quantitative work. This  
effect has increased over time, from 4.17 in the  
early period to 6.38 in the later period. Adding  
coauthorship to the model significantly  
improves the model fit, attenuating the magni-  
tude of the specialty effects, though they are  
generally substantively similar to those in model  
2. This suggests that, while research method is  
clearly important, research specialty still makes  
a unique contribution to the odds of coauthor-  
ship.  
These models suggest that coauthorship  
might be bifurcating across specialties, which  
is likely due to an increasing rate of coauthor-  
ship growth in the less interpretive fields. Once  
a division of labor process takes hold, it likely  
propagates as mentors teach students that coau-  
thoring and collaboration is normative. As such,  
we should expect continual growth in the inci-  
dence of coauthorship within these specialty  
areas. This bifurcation suggests that, to the  
extent that theoretical integration follows social  
integration, a theoretical gulf will mirror the net-  
work participation pattern. Those specialties  
that are least likely to collaborate are thus less  
likely to be theoretically integrated with those  
that are more likely to collaborate.  
COLLABORATION NETWORK  
STRUCTURE  
While the models presented above tell us who  
coauthors, they tell us nothing about the struc-  
ture of the network given coauthorship. The  
discussion presented above suggest three com-  
peting models: A preferential attachment model,  
suggesting a structure reliant on star producers;  
a small-world model, where specialty areas  
cluster into distinct social groups; and a struc-  
tural cohesion model that suggests a broad over-  
arching connectivity among a large portion of  
the network.  
DOES THE NETWORK DEPEND ON STAR  
COLLABORATORS?  
If the observed network were generated through  
a preferential attachment process, the distribu-  
tion of number of coauthors would follow a  
power-law distribution, which will be seen as a  
straight line when plotted on a log-log scale. The  
distribution of the total number of collaborators  
is given in the last three columns of table 1, and  
presented graphically in Figure 4. For the full  
network, about 37% of authors have only writ-  
ten with one other person, and about 22% have  
written with 2 others. The distribution of coau-  
thors has a fatter tail in the 89-99 period com-  
pared to the 75-85 period, with fewer nodes  
having only one coauthor and more people with  
3 or more coauthors.  
The observed distribution does not fit a strict  
power law, having a curved, rather than linear  
shape, suggesting that the network was not STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 227

Figure 4. Scale-Free properties of Coauthorship Networks 228 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW  
generated solely by a preferential attachment  
process. Most prior research on power-law dis-  
tributions tests for a power-law by fitting a  
regression line to the observed points in the  
log-log space. Using the simple regression  
approach, in each case the fit is improved by  
adding a squared term to the regression, indi-  
cating that the relation is not linear.22  
Substantively, the key interest in scale-free  
networks lies in the extent to which a small  
number of high-degree actors are responsible for  
connecting the network, which puts them in a  
uniquely powerful position for influencing the  
direction of scientific practice. While the degree  
distribution does not conform to a strict power  
law, it is highly skewed, so it makes sense to test  
for this structural property directly. The second  
line in each panel of figure 3 (called component  
sensitivity) gives the size of the largest con-  
nected component when all actors with that  
degree or more are removed from the graph. It  
is clear from the figure, that the networks hold  
together well into the bulk of the tail, not dis-  
connecting until we remove all actors with  
greater than 8-10 collaborators. While a minor-  
ity of the total network has 8 or more collabo-  
rators, one would still have to remove over 500  
of the most active nodes to disconnect the net-  
work. This network is not held together by a  
small number of network stars. Thus, while the  
network contains clear star actors - people with  
a disproportionate number of ties, and such  
actors are likely very influential within a local  
region of the network, information diffusion  
through the network does not depend on such  
actors.  
A SOCIOLOGICAL SMALL WORLD?  
Is the social science collaboration network char-  
acterized by distinct clusters that are weakly  
connected to each other? Using formulas devel-  
oped by Newman et al. (2001), we can test the  
observed graph properties relative to a random  
graph with a similar joint distribution of authors  
and papers. Any network that has significantly  
greater local clustering than expected by chance  
and average distances about equal to chance  
are considered small-world networks (Watts  
1999; Watts and Strogatz 1998). Formally, one  
measures local clustering with the clustering  
coefficient, C, which is the proportion of all two-  
step contacts (collaborator's collaborators) that  
are also directly connected (called the transi-  
tivity index in prior work [Davis 1970; Davis  
and Leinhardt 1972; Harary et al. 1965; Holland  
and Leinhardt 1971]) and distance with 1, the  
average path length between connected nodes.  
A small-world network has clustering that is  
higher than expected and average distances  
roughly equivalent to that expected in a random  
network of similar size and distribution of num-  
ber of partners.  
The top panel of Table 4 compares the clus-  
tering and path length statistics for the observed  
networks to the random expectation. For the  
first period, the observed clustering coefficient,  
C, is .194, which is not substantively different  
from the expected random value of .207. For the  
total network, the observed characteristic path  
length, 1, is 9.81, which is significantly longer  
than the expected 7.57. Thus, distances are  
greater, and relations less clustered, than would  
be expected in a random graph with similar  
contribution structures, which means the graph  
does not have a small-world structure.  
This result is largely replicated for the two  
period-specific networks. In each case, the clus-  
tering coefficient is a little smaller than random  
expectations, but distances are significantly  
greater than expected under random mixing, in  
direct contradiction to the small-world model.  
These findings suggest that the collaboration  
network is not composed of distinct, separate  
clusters. Instead, permeable theoretical bound-  
aries likely result in a network that folds in on  
itself, connecting people at greater distances  
from widely different specialties.  
22 Jones and Handcock (2003) have recently cri-  
tiqued much of this work. The regression method  
improperly weights cases and fails to account for  
autocorrelation between points. Their alternative  
maximum likelihood techniques also suggest that  
the observed data do not conform to a preferential attachment process. When viewed in the aggregate,  
the degree distribution is best fit with a variant of a  
negative binomial model, when viewed in the short  
run (75-85, 89-99) none of the standard models fit  
the observed distributions particularly well, sug-  
gesting that many alternative factors determine the  
number of collaborators. Thanks to Mark Handcock  
for providing these models. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 229

STRUCTURAL COHESION?  
The final model based on commentaries of the  
discipline suggests a broad-based structurally  
cohesive collaboration network. The minimum  
requirement for cohesion is connectivity, and  
thus increases in the size of the largest con-  
nected component are a basic requirement for  
structural cohesion. While a necessary sub-  
strate, a component can be quite fragile, since  
removing a single person can disconnect the  
network. A stronger criterion for cohesion is the  
size of the largest bicomponent.23  
We need a benchmark to meaningfully judge  
the size of a component or bicomponent in  
empirical networks. I construct comparison net-  
works by randomly assigning the observed set  
of authors to the observed set of papers (which  
retains the observed publication volume distri-  
butions), then construct a random collabora-  
tion network from these randomized  
authorships. This is preferable to simply ran-  
domizing edges in the full network, since it  
maintains the necessary clustering that results  
from multiple authors on a single paper.  
Moreover, an authorship randomization  
approach allows me to control other mixing  
features, such as homophily on number of pub-  
lications or the distribution of authors across  
specialties. If changes in the inclusion of a par-  
ticular specialty with more coauthorships in the  
database were driving results, randomizing with-  
in specialty would effectively account for this  
bias. It should also be noted that components  
and bicomponents in random graphs effective-  
ly form an upper bound on component size,  
since under random mixing the components  
quickly converge to cover the entire graph  
(Palmer 1985). As such, the meaningful com-  
23 I focus here on the size of the largest bicompo-  
nent, but smaller bicomponents do exist in the net-  
work. However, they are usually many orders of  
magnitude smaller than the largest component. For  
example, the second largest bicomponent in the  
pooled network has fewer than 50 nodes. 23o AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW  
parison over time is how much closer to the  
random value we get, conditional on the relevant  
mixing features of the network. These compar-  
isons are given in the bottom panel of table 4.  
Nearly half of all collaborating authors  
(68,285) are members of a single connected  
component, meaning that it is possible to trace  
a path from each to the other through coau-  
thorship chains. This is about 72% of chance  
levels, if one simply assigned all authors to  
papers at random. In all years, the next-largest  
component is orders of magnitude smaller than  
the giant component. For the full network, near-  
ly 60% of people who have coauthored but are  
not in the largest component are scattered across  
components of 2 or 3 people.  
Simple random assignment, however, ignores  
the fact that many authors are only represented  
because they have coauthored a single paper that  
generates isolated dyads (cases such as { E and  
F} in figure 2). We can set the randomization  
process to match this parameter, ensuring that  
our simulated network contains as many nec-  
essarily isolated dyads as observed in the real  
graph (Random Paper + One Pub condition).  
Doing so lowers the expected size of the giant  
component. Compared to this more realistic  
simulation, the observed giant component is  
about 87% of the random expectation.24  
Looking over time, we see that the proportion  
of the population in the largest component has  
steadily increased relative to random expecta-  
tion. Based on the one-pub restriction, the  
largest component in the early period was 49%  
of random expectation, rising to 75% of random  
expectation in the later period.  
We find a similar story with respect to the size  
of the largest bicomponent. Bicomponents are  
nested within components, and 43% (29,462  
people) of the members of the largest compo-  
nent are also members of the largest bicompo-  
nent, or about 60% of the random expected  
size. Again, the relative proportion has increased  
over time, moving from 26% in the early peri-  
od to 48% in the later period (based on the one-  
pub randomization model).25  
Theoretical consensus should be higher  
among pairs of people embedded in higher-  
order k-components. While a complete cohesive  
blocking (Moody and White 2003) of the total  
coauthorship network is impossible because of  
its size, we can estimate the distribution of high-  
er-order connectivity for the entire graph based  
on the connectivity distribution among a sam-  
ple of dyads. By definition, every pair in the  
largest component (N = 68,285) has at least 1  
path connecting them, and every pair within  
the largest bicomponent (N = 29,462) has at  
least two paths. Nested within this bicomponent,  
the largest tricomponent has approximately  
14,627 (CI = 14,372-15,375) members, the  
largest 4-component has approximately 7,992  
(CI = 6972-8068), and approximately 5,203  
(CI = 4564-5667) are connected by 5 or more  
independent paths.26  
Higher-order connectivity appears to have  
increased over time as well. The bicomponent  
for the 1975-1985 period is small enough to  
allow a complete enumeration of all nested con-  
24 Additional controls were checked, including  
conditioning on mixing by number of authors beyond isolated dyads (equivalent to fixing the diagonal of  
the mixing matrix, while the 'one-pub' condition  
only fixes the 1,1 cell), and constraining mixing within areas, which accounts for changes in special-  
ty representation over time. Neither of these restric-  
tions have as strong an effect on the expected values  
as the one-pub restriction. Tables available on request.  
25 Because bicomponents must be nested within  
components, and because our observed component is smaller than the random component, directly com-  
paring the size of the observed bicomponent to the  
random graph somewhat underestimates the relative  
cohesion in the observed network. To account for this  
underestimate, I present the ratio of the size of the  
largest bicomponent to the size of the largest com-  
ponent for both the observed and the random graph. These figures also show that cohesion has increased  
over time, from .51 in the early period to .65 in the  
later period.  
26 Estimates are based on the number of node-  
independent paths connecting randomly sampled  
pairs of nodes. I then back-estimate the size of the k-  
component from the distribution of node-independ-  
ent paths. I estimate confidence intervals by  
bootstrapping the resulting distribution, then using distribution means at 5% and 95%. Because this esti-  
mate is based on a sample, it is impossible to iden-  
tify the sets of nodes that comprise the higher-order  
k-components. These should probably be taken as  
high-end estimates, since people can belong to dif-  
ferent k-components, though my informal explo- rations of these data suggest that this is unlikely at  
these lower k-levels. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 231  
nectivity sets. Here we find that while there are  
many 3 and 4 components in the network, they  
are always very small (usually less than 10  
members). These small higher-order k-compo-  
nents are linked together within the larger  
bicomponent in a manner that suggests a 'ridge-  
structure', where each group is partially embed-  
ded with other groups (Friedkin 1998). This is  
an image of a loose federation of coauthors  
linked within the wider cohesive set (though the  
core in the early period is only a small fraction  
of the total), with no significant schisms sepa-  
rating the network.  
The 1989-1999 period admits to a greater  
fraction of the (much larger) bicomponent  
embedded in higher-order k-components.  
Approximately 5,023 (CI = 4,827-5,200) nodes  
are embedded in a 3-component, while 2,763  
(CI = 2,559-2,885) are in a 4 component and  
1,616 (CI = 1,368-1,703) are in components of  
k > 4. From these estimates, it appears that a  
substantial number of social scientists are deeply  
embedded within a highly cohesive coauthor-  
ship core, and that the size of this core has  
increased over time.  
How are these cohesive sets related to each  
other in the network? The general shape of the  
network can be best represented with a con-  
tour sociogram.27 In a traditional sociogram,  
points are arrayed spatially to minimize the dis-  
tance between connected points and maximize  
the distance between disconnected points, as  
with the largest component in figure 2. For very  
large networks, a point-and-line sociogram is  
uninformative, because nodes simply crowd  
each other out, stacking on top of each other to  
reveal a largely uninformative cloud (just as a  
scatter plot of thousands of points often results  
in what appears to be an even spread over the  
entire space). However, we can use the bivari-  
ate distribution of points in this space to iden-  
tify concentrations of nodes in the network.  
Any region of the graph with a comparatively  
high level of cohesion will have a larger num-  
ber of nodes crowded together in that region, and  
thus a higher probability density value.28  
Figure 5 presents the contour plot for the largest  
bicomponent of the pooled network.  
The general spherical distribution of nodes  
(there are no nodes outside the .21 contour)  
suggests that actors are spread relatively even-  
ly across the possible space, showing no major  
divisions.29 Within this comparatively flat ter-  
rain, there are two more prominent hills (seen  
here as those areas with a density of 2.74 and  
higher), connected by a high-density ridge  
(within the 2.11 contour). A primary subgroup  
analysis of the largest bicomponent reveals that  
the two peaks differ in the topics studied.30 The  
highest hill in the "South-East" section corre-  
sponds to people writing in general sociology,  
while the "North-Central" hill has a concentra-  
tion of people writing in applied health fields.  
As is always the case with cluster analytic  
techniques, it is tempting to reify such clusters  
at the expense of the general topology. Friedkin  
(1998) notes that the cluster structure of a net-  
work can be compared to geographical topog-  
raphy, and describes "ridge structures" as  
"sequentially overlapping and densely occu-  
pied regions of the social space" (p.125). This  
ridge-structure image seems appropriate for the  
internal structure of the observed collaboration  
network. There are areas of relative concentra-  
tion, but they overlap substantially. As sug-  
gested by previous work on the structure of  
sociology specialties (Cappell and Guterbock  
1992; Daipha 2001; Ennis 1992; Richards  
1984), high levels of intergroup contact, weak  
internal structure, and strong overall connec-  
tivity point toward a generalized cohesion with-  
in the sociology coauthorship core. This is a  
structure that should promote theoretical inte-  
gration, since ideas and information can poten-  
27 To my knowledge, this is the first time networks  
have been represented with this type of figure. 28 The concentration of points is often very uneven,  
resulting in very jagged contour plots. I have used a  
non-parametric kernal density estimation technique  
to smooth the resulting surface, with a bandwidth of  
.8. Alternative figures with less smoothing are avail-  
able from the author on request. 29 Contrast the relatively even distribution of nodes  
here with a large racially segregated network, such  
as http://www.sociology.ohio-state.edu/jwm/racel.gif.  
30 Prior versions of this paper included a detailed  
analysis of the subgroup structure of the core bicom-

SPECIALTY AREA AND STRUCTURAL  
EMBEDDEDNESS  
If a particular type of social science dominates  
the coauthorship core, then this connected group  
might have greater influence in shaping questions  
in the field (Crane 1972). If, instead, specialties  
are evenly distributed across the network, then we  
have greater evidence for functional integration  
(Hargens 1975). We can model individual  
embeddedness within the coauthorship network  
using a modeling strategy parallel to that used for  
network participation. The dependent variable  
now is structural embeddedness (Moody and  
White 2003) in the network: those in small iso-  
lated components are coded 1, those in the largest  
connected component are coded 2, and those in  
the largest bicomponent are coded 3. These  
results appear in Table 5.  
In addition to measures defined for the net-  
work participation models, I add additional  
measures based on the local network patterns.  
I control for network volume measures, includ-  
ing the number of unique collaborators and the  
average number of authors per paper.  
Mentorship captures the preferential attachment  
hypothesis directly by looking at the relative  
publication frequency of coauthors. Mentorship  
is measured as the number of publications for  
the focal individual minus the number of publi-  
cations for his/her coauthor, averaged over all STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 233

coauthors. Mentors will thus have large positive  
scores. Coauthor diversity measures the extent to  
which a person coauthors with different coau-  
thors, relative to their opportunity to coauthor  
with others. This is calculated as the number of  
observed coauthors divided by the maximum pos-  
sible number of coauthors given the number of  
papers published and the number of authors on  
each paper.31 We would expect that those who  
have higher coauthor diversity would be more  
deeply embedded in the coauthorship network.  
As with network participation, time in the dis-  
cipline (exposure) increases the likelihood of being  
in the core of the network, though more so in the  
later period than in the early period. As expected,  
the number of publications is also a strong pre-  
dictor of being in the core, as is the number of  
unique coauthors. Relative diversity of coauthor-  
ship patterns results in a lower likelihood of being  
at the core overall, but the magnitude is small and  
inconsistent over time. In the later period, coau-  
thorship diversity increases the likelihood of being  
at the core of the network, while it is nonsignifi-  
cant in the early period. Mentorship is consis-  
tently negatively related to being at the heart of the  
network. To the extent that this type of publication  
pattern captures shop production, it may be that  
those shops are relatively isolated or that students  
do not then go on to write with new people.32 Just  
as males were less likely to coauthor, conditional  
on coauthorship, males are less likely to occupy  
the core of the network suggesting that females are  
strongly integrated into the overall network core  
of the discipline.33  
Looking at the multivariate models for spe-  
cialty area (model 2), the general pattern of coef-  
ficients is similar to that for network participation.  
Those writing in areas such as theory and culture  
are slightly more likely to be at the periphery of  
the network and social psychology, sociology of  
business, family and social welfare more likely to  
be at the core, but the magnitudes are much small-  
er. Many of the areas are not statistically distin-  
guishable from average, even with the large  
statistical power in these models, and the relative  
size of the odds ratios is much closer to 1 than in  
the coauthorship models. A clear summary of the  
weakness of specialty for predicting embeddedness  
is seen in the change in model fit with and with-  
out specialty fields. Across all three networks, the  
models only weakly improve by adding specialty  
area to the individual attributes. Turning to model  
3, we find that quantitative work increases embed-  
dedness, but has almost no effect on the value of  
the specialty area coefficients nor does it improve  
the model much.  
Substantively, these models suggest that once  
one enters the coauthorship network, the key pre-  
dictors of position are individual and publication  
characteristics. In contrast to network involve-  
ment, specialty area is a weak predictor of network  
embeddedness. Turning this finding around, it  
suggests that the cohesive core is spread relative-  
ly evenly across the specialty areas at risk to coau-  
thorship.34  
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION:  
SOCIAL INTEGRATION IN THE  
SOCIAL SCIENCES  
Coauthorship is becoming increasingly more com-  
mon in the social sciences. Nearly half of all  
papers and over two thirds of all papers in the  
31 Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for sug-  
gesting these measures.  
32 1 have also tested a cohort based mentor meas-  
ure, identifying those authors that are older than  
their coauthors (as measured by first publication  
appearance). The measure is either unrelated to  
core membership or negative, in much the same  
way as the publication volume measure.  
33 Prior analyses on the subgroup structure sug-  
gests that membership in smaller groups within the  
largest bicomponent differ by gender, with males  
more likely to be in the peak region at the south-  
east corner of figure 5. As with the coauthorship  
model, the embeddedness model benefits by con-  
trolling for database coverage. Those authors who  
publish in complete or priority journals are more  
likely to be in the core of the network.  
34 Previous readers suggested that this perme-  
ability might be due to the large number of peo-  
ple with few publications (such as graduate students who publish in disparate areas). Having  
published little, they may be unimportant to the  
general character of sociological production. In  
response, I have constructed a network of people with more than 3 publications and who have been  
in the discipline for more than 5 years. This sig-  
nificantly lowers the sample size but not its gen- eral topology. A greater proportion of people are  
in the largest bicomponent, but the bicomponent is no more fractured than when using the full  
sample. STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE COLLABORATION NETWORK 235  
ASR are coauthored. Coauthorship is not even-  
ly distributed across sociological work. As pre-  
dicted by others, coauthorship is more likely in  
specialties that admit to an easier division of  
labor. Research method seems particularly  
important, showing that quantitative work is  
more likely to be coauthored than non-quanti-  
tative work. While there is a specialty gap in net-  
work participation, among those who have  
participated, specialty area is only a weak pre-  
dictor of network embeddedness. Thus, just as  
heterogeneity provides only limited informa-  
tion on social integration (Moody 2001), obser-  
vations about fractionalization in the discipline  
based on increasing numbers of specialties  
might be misleading. The coauthorship pattern  
shows a steadily growing cohesive core, sug-  
gesting that while authors might specialize,  
their skills marry well with others creating an  
integrated collaboration network.  
How do we account for the observed col-  
laboration pattern? Two complimentary images  
of science production are suggestive. Abbott's  
(2001) description of social science as having  
permeable theoretical boundaries suggests that  
specialization within the social sciences does  
not necessarily generate divisions between spe-  
cialists. Instead, competitors actively borrow  
ideas from each other (even if under new  
names), to cover the available idea space. This  
free mixing means that one's coauthors need  
not coauthor with each other, and thus the net-  
work as a whole admits to little clustering and  
few schisms, instead spreading quickly over the  
relevant idea spaces represented in the disci-  
pline. Friedkin's (1998) work suggests a spe-  
cialty analogue to Abbott's competitive mixing  
model. Friedkin found that while contact clus-  
tered within specialties, these clusters where  
strongly connected to each other, creating net-  
work conduits through which ideas and infor-  
mation flow. Tie heterogeneity within groups  
means that groups can act as bridges between  
other groups but still maintain internal cohe-  
sion (Paxton and Moody 2002). Fleshing these  
hypotheses out will require examining the  
internal structure of the collaboration network  
in more detail, though preliminary work sug-  
gests that Friedkin's model fits for short-run  
images of later periods of the collaboration  
graph.  
What do these findings suggest for the  
prospects of scientific consensus in sociolo-  
gy?35 Data limitations demand cautious inter-  
pretations, but the structure is suggestive. First,  
the two most prominent models for consensus  
in an idea space are through references to rec-  
ognized authority (Martin 2002; Crane 1972) or  
distributed interpersonal influence (Friedkin  
1998). Both models suggest that systematic dif-  
ferences in network participation will generate  
an ideational gulf between those involved in  
the network and those without collaborations.  
In this case, the major divide centers largely on  
research method (quantitative or not) and the-  
oretical focus (radical, cultural, and interpretive  
modes against largely positivist and empiricist  
modes). While this gulf appears substantial,  
increasing collaboration over-time suggests that  
it might be shrinking.  
The two theoretical approaches offer slight-  
ly different predictions for future consensus  
within the connected collaboration network.  
The interpersonal influence model suggests that  
high overall cohesion will generate generalized  
consensus, as ideas circulate among the scien-  
tists connected in the network, though the long-  
term nature of the network suggests this might  
be a slow affair. A finer-level prediction is that  
consensus should be directly correlated with  
structural embeddedness, and those embedded  
in higher order k-components would be more  
similar to each other than those at the fringes of  
the network. However, the network does admit  
to a large inequality in numbers of collaborators,  
indicating clear stars even though these stars are  
not essential for connecting the entire network.  
Martin's authority-based perspective would sug-  
gest that those actors with many collaborators  
might have much more influence shaping ideas  
35 While suggestive, such proposals come with  
large caveats. Although coauthorship is a clear indi-  
cator of social connection, it is a stringent one. The  
trace of interaction can be found only after the col-  
laboration is recorded through publication. It is like-  
ly that other types of social interaction are layered on  
top of the coauthorship network, which would like-  
ly lead to greater levels of cohesion than that observed  
through the coauthorship network. Second, the  
SociologicalAbstract area codes may correlate only  
weakly with the humanist-positivist division that  
troubles many sociologists, building necessary ambi-  
guity into these findings. Third, the database ignores  
book publications, which might systematically  
exclude some areas more than others. 236 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW  
than others, perhaps acting as "pumps" for ideas  
that are then quickly circulated through the  
well-connected regions of the collaboration  
graph.  
While we lack the data necessary to answer  
this question directly, I suspect that the two  
approaches are both correct for different aspects  
of scientific consensus. I suspect that the high  
overall cohesion levels will generate consensus  
with respect to methods and rules of evidence,  
but that stars will act as "area authorities" with  
respect to particular theoretical or empirical  
claims. Thus, as methodological change con-  
tinues to foster a division of labor based on  
how we do research, this will generate consen-  
sus on what counts as valid evidence for mak-  
ing scientific claims. However, competition for  
status within the discipline will likely revolve  
around stars who generate new ideas at the  
intersection of different research specialties.  
Classic treatments of the division of labor sug-  
gest that such integrated specialization should  
lead to organic solidarity, though this need not  
lead to a unification of particular ideas  
(Durkheim [1933] 1984; Hargens 1975;  
Hagstrom 1965; Whitley 2000). Perhaps, then,  
as Durkheim first suggested, cohesive collabo-  
ration networks will simultaneously allow for  
theoretical diversity and scientific consensus.
